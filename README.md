## ðŸ“Œ Note
The following guidelines apply to the **`batch` version** of MOFFlow, as introduced in **Appendix D** of our paper. This version is a refactored implementation designed for **faster training**.

The experiments in the main paper were conducted using the original **`timebatch`** version, which you can access with:

```bash
git checkout timebatch
```

However, we recommend using the `batch` version, as it achieves convergence significantly faster â€” 1â€“2 days compared to about 1 week with timebatch.

## Installation

### Clone repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/nayoung10/MOFFlow.git # clone repo
cd MOFFlow
```

### Setup environment

```bash
mamba env create -f env.yml
mamba activate mofflow
pip install git+https://github.com/microsoft/MOFDiff.git
pip install -e .
```

For **property computation**, please install `zeo++` from [here](https://www.zeoplusplus.org/download.html). 

### Setup ```.env``` file

Create ```.env``` file with following entries. 
```bash
export PROJECT_ROOT=<root_dir>
export ZEO_PATH=<path_to_network_binary> # for property computation
```

## Dataset & checkpoints

You can download the dataset and checkpoints from [zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/15187230).
Place the dataset files under `data/mof/cif_200_inf`. 

## Training

### Training from scratch

The following code starts training from scratch. All paths/directory information are in ```configs/paths.yaml```; modify as needed. 

```bash
python experiments/train.py experiment.wandb.name=<expname>
```

### Continue training from checkpoint

To continue training from ```<ckpt_path>``` in experiment ```<expname>```

```bash
python experiments/train.py \
    experiment.wandb.name=<expname> \
    experiment.warm_start=<ckpt_path> \
    +experiment.wandb.id=<run_id> \ # wandb run ID (optional)
    +experiment.wandb.resume=must # resume wandb run
```

## Evaluation 

### RMSD

To evaluate structure prediction accuracy via RMSD, run the following command.

```bash
# Adjust settings as needed
export MKL_NUM_THREADS=1 # adjust as needed
export NUMEXPR_NUM_THREADS=1
export OMP_NUM_THREADS=1

python experiments/evaluate.py
    --save_pt <path/to/predict.pt> \
    --num_samples <k> \ # inferred from data shape if not provided; use if k < k_generated
    --num_cpus <ncpu> \ # default to 48
```

### Property computation (with `zeo++`)

To compute structural properties (e.g., surface area, pore volume), run:

```bash
# Adjust settings as needed
export MKL_NUM_THREADS=1
export NUMEXPR_NUM_THREADS=1
export OMP_NUM_THREADS=1

python evaluation/property.py --cif_dir <inference_dir> --ncpu <num_cpus>
```
